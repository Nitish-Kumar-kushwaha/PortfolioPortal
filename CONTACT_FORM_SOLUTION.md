## Implementation Details

### What I Fixed:
1. **Email Client Integration** - Form now opens user's default email client with pre-filled content
2. **Direct Contact Options** - Added quick buttons for Email, LinkedIn, and Phone
3. **Professional UX** - Clear messaging about how the contact form works
