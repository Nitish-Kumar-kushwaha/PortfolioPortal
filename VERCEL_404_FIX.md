# Fix Vercel 404 Error - Simple Solution

## The Issue
404 NOT_FOUND error means Vercel can't find your built files or there's a routing issue.

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Solution 1: Use GitHub Pages Instead (Recommended)
GitHub Pages is much simpler and more reliable for React portfolios:

1. **Go to your repository**: `https://github.com/Nitish-Kumar-kushwaha/PortfolioPortal`
2. **Settings → Pages**
3. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
4. **Create workflow file**: Add this to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

```yaml
name: Deploy Portfolio

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        
    - name: Install and Build
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build
        
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./dist/public
```

**Your site will be live at**: `https://nitish-kumar-kushwaha.github.io/PortfolioPortal`

### Solution 2: Try Netlify
Netlify handles React apps much better:

1. **Go to**: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **New site from Git** → Select PortfolioPortal
3. **Build settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
4. **Deploy**

### Solution 3: Fix Vercel Configuration
Try this simplified approach:

1. **Delete current Vercel deployment**
2. **In Vercel dashboard**:
   - Framework Preset: **Other**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

## Why This Happens
- Vercel expects specific file structures
- Your app has both frontend and backend
- Build output path confusion
- Routing configuration issues

## Best Recommendation: GitHub Pages
- **Free hosting** directly from your repository
- **Simple setup** with GitHub Actions
- **Reliable** for React applications
- **Professional URL** for your portfolio

Your portfolio is ready with:
- Enhanced timeline design
- Dark/light mode
- Responsive layout
- All your projects and experience

GitHub Pages will give you a clean, professional URL that works perfectly for portfolios!
